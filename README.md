This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a subtle bug involving the foreach loop and the last statement. The script intends to print elements of an array until the element 2 is encountered. However, due to the placement of the last statement, the loop terminates before printing all elements before 2. The solution provides a corrected version to achieve the intended behavior.
